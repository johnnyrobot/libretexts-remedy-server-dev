"""Content-stream reordering — make the PHYSICAL marked-content order match the
structure tree's logical reading order.

Screen readers and PDF/UA follow the structure tree (``/StructTreeRoot``), which
the engine's reading-order fixes already correct. But Acrobat's *Order* panel,
*Read Out Loud*, *Reflow*, copy/paste and search follow the page **content
stream** — the physical sequence of ``/Tag <</MCID n>> BDC … BT … ET … EMC``
drawing blocks. The engine never re-sequences that stream, so on multi-column /
designed pages the two orders disagree: the tags read correctly, the visible
"order" is still scrambled.

This module re-sequences the movable (tagged, text-bearing) marked-content
blocks of a page so their physical order matches the struct-tree reading order,
WITHOUT changing what is drawn or where.

How it stays faithful (verified against the LAMC career-major template):
  * Each tagged unit is an atomic, non-nested ``/Tag <</MCID n>> BDC … EMC``
    block whose ``BT … ET`` text object is fully contained. Moving the block
    moves its whole text object.
  * MCIDs are referenced by NUMBER from the struct tree + ``/ParentTree`` — not
    by position — so we reorder blocks **without renumbering**. Struct linkage
    and veraPDF PDF/UA-1 validity are preserved.
  * The one hazard is graphics-state leakage: a block's glyphs depend on the CTM
    / colour / ExtGState / persistent text-state set by surrounding ``q … Q``.
    We fix this by capturing the *effective* graphics state at each block's
    ``BDC`` and re-establishing it inside a fresh ``q … Q`` wrapper around the
    moved block (CTM/colour/gs outside ``BT``; persistent text state injected
    right after ``BT``). Position then no longer affects rendering.
  * Non-movable content (artifacts, images, paths, bare graphics, and the
    original ``q … Q`` scaffolding) is emitted first, in its original order, so
    background painting and z-order are unchanged. Reordered text is painted on
    top — correct for designed pages where text sits over backgrounds.

The caller is expected to gate every page with a render pixel-diff (see
``reorder_pdf_to_struct_order``'s ``render_gate``): any page whose rendering
would change is reverted to its original stream. Combined with a struct-leaf and
text-multiset check upstream, the pass is safe-by-construction — it produces a
pixel-identical page or no change at all.

Only the page ``/Contents`` are rewritten. The structure tree, ``/ParentTree``,
MCID numbers, fonts and resources are untouched.

    identical render guarantees no glyph was moved, dropped or recoloured. (Note:
    ``pdftotext`` word counts are NOT a reliable gate here — extraction order is
    itself content-stream-order-dependent, so a faithful reorder can legitimately
    change them.) The default threshold cleanly separates faithful reorders
    (≤1e-4 from anti-aliasing at z-order edges) from blocks that rely on inherited
    text positioning and would shift (≥6e-4).

    The struct tree, MCID numbers and ParentTree are not touched, so PDF/UA
    validity is preserved; the caller may additionally verify with veraPDF.
